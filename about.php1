      <p>We came up to this concept “itchy feet” that is because us Filipino had a thinking that whenever our feet feel itchy we want to go somewhere. NOT, because we have skin allergy or something. Especially, that we are experiencing pandemic we were locked up to our houses for almost a year without any other activities like going to school, mall, go to gym and go to different places to travel and explore. <br> <br> A lot of people right now are excited to go somewhere to travel, explore and relax again. We saw a lot of post in social media that people are going back to their track, they are going to beach, they do hiking again, they go out of town. That's why we made a new service that will help a lot of people who are excited to go somewhere to relax, travel, explore or go around wherever they please without worrying about where they'll spend their night.
